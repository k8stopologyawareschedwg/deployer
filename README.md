# topology-aware-scheduling deployer

`deployer` is a set of go packages and a command line tool to setup all the components and settings needed to enable
the topology-aware-scheduling on a kubernetes cluster. Additionally, the tool can validate if the cluster configuration
is compatible to the topology-aware-scheduling requirements.

## goals and rationale

the `deployer` project wants to help anyone which want to work with the topology-aware scheduling stack providing:

- a curated package including all the relevant components: CRD API, scheduler plugin, updater agent; a (growing) testsuite
  and a explicit review process ensure that the component work well together.
- a single-artifact, no-dependencies tool to verify a given kubernetes or openshift cluster configuration is compatible
  with the topology-aware scheduling stack, offering suggestions for changes.
- a single-artifact, no-dependecies tool to install/uninstall all the topology-aware scheduling stack on any
  kubernetes or openshift cluster.
- a single, up-to-date, source for all the manifests needed by the topology-aware stack components
- a set of reusable golang packages which can be used by other golang projects to deploy/undeploy or in general
  interact with the topology-aware stack components (e.g. operators)

## requirements

* kubernetes >= 1.21
* a valid `kubeconfig`
* **validation only** `kubectl` >= 1.21 in your `PATH`

## compatibility matrix

| Deployer | NodeResourceTopology CRD version | Scheduler plugins version | RTE version | NFD version           |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0.12.0   | v0.1.1                           | dev snapshot 20230315     | v0.10.z     | dev snapshot 20230315 |
| 0.11.0   | v0.1.1                           | dev snapshot 20230315     | v0.10.z     | dev snapshot 20230315 |
| 0.10.0   | v0.0.12                          | v0.24.9                   | v0.9.z      | v0.12.z               |

## how does it work?

### rendering manifests

The `depoloyer` tool can render manifests for the topology-aware stack components, instead of sending them to the cluster.
The manifests are rendered using the same code paths used by the tool internally, so they are functionally identically
to the manifests the tool uses for its internal operations. See the `render` command:
```
$ deployer help render
render all the manifests

Usage:
  deployer render [flags]
  deployer render [command]

Available Commands:
  api              render the APIs needed for topology-aware-scheduling
  scheduler-plugin render the scheduler plugin needed for topology-aware-scheduling
  topology-updater render the topology updater needed for topology-aware-scheduling

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for render

Global Flags:
  -P, --platform string          platform to deploy on
      --pull-if-not-present      force pull policies to IfNotPresent.
  -R, --replicas int             set the replica value - where relevant. (default 1)
      --rte-config-file string   inject rte configuration reading from this file.

Use "deployer render [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### deploy on a kubernetes cluster

Considering a kind cluster configured like this:
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kubeadmConfigPatches:
- |
  kind: KubeletConfiguration
  cpuManagerPolicy: "static"
  topologyManagerPolicy: "single-numa-node"
  reservedSystemCPUs: "0,16"
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

Deploy all the topology-aware scheduling components:
```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   3m48s   v1.21.1
kind-worker          Ready    worker                 3m15s   v1.21.1
kind-worker2         Ready    worker                 3m15s   v1.21.1
kind-worker3         Ready    worker                 3m15s   v1.21.1

### validate the cluster configuration:

A kind cluster with the correct configuration:
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kubeadmConfigPatches:
- |
  kind: KubeletConfiguration
  cpuManagerPolicy: "static"
  topologyManagerPolicy: "single-numa-node"
  reservedSystemCPUs: "0,16"
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

Does pass the validation:
```
$ ./deployer validate
PASSED>>: the cluster configuration looks ok!
```

A kind cluster configured like this
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kubeadmConfigPatches:
- |
  kind: KubeletConfiguration
  cpuManagerPolicy: "static"
  reservedSystemCPUs: "0,16"
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
- role: worker
```

Does **not** pass the validation:
```
$ ./deployer validate
